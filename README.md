# 🌫️ Delhi Air Quality Analysis Project

This project analyzes air quality trends in Delhi using real-world environmental data. It focuses on key pollutants like **PM2.5**, **PM10**, **NO2**, **SO2**, **CO**, and **Ozone**, along with the **Air Quality Index (AQI)**. The analysis helps understand the impact of seasonal changes, holidays, and other factors on air pollution levels.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/delhi_air_quality.git
cd delhi_air_quality
```

### 2. Install required packages

If you don’t have a `requirements.txt` file, install manually:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### 3. Run the Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook delhi_air_quality.ipynb
```

## ❓ Sample Questions Explored

- How does AQI change over different months and years?
- What are the most harmful pollutants in Delhi?
- Does air quality improve on holidays or weekends?
- What is the relationship between different pollutants?

---

## 📌 Future Work

- Add predictive analysis using Machine Learning  
- Live AQI updates using API  
- Create a dashboard using Streamlit or Dash
